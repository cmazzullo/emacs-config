# emacs-config

My (understated) emacs config.

I've tried to keep third-party packages and modifications to vanilla
emacs to a minimum.

To use this configuration file, either:

1. Copy the file to ~/.emacs.d/

2. Clone this repository somewhere, then add this line to the top of
your ~/.emacs.d/init.el file:

```emacs-lisp
(load "~/cloned-repo-location/init.el")
;; --- Your customizations below --- ;;
```
